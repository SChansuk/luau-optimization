## Preface

This document is intended for intermediate Roblox developers (
    i.e. those who have a basic understanding of Roblox Studio API and Luau) who want to improve the performance of their games.

This book contains guidelines and advices on how to write efficient software using the Luau language. Software correctness and maintainability are taken into account, 
but are not the primary concerns of the guidelines. The guidelines are focused on performance and efficiency.
